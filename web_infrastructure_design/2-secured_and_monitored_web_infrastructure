## Infrastructure Overview

This three-server secured infrastructure for www.foobar.com includes security measures and monitoring:

### Components:

1. **3 Firewalls**:
   - Protect each server
   - Control incoming/outgoing traffic
   - Network security enforcement

2. **SSL Certificate (HTTPS)**:
   - Encrypts client-server communication
   - Serves www.foobar.com over HTTPS
   - Ensures data privacy and integrity

3. **3 Monitoring Clients**:
   - Data collectors on each server
   - Performance and health metrics
   - Real-time monitoring

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - SSL termination
   - Traffic distribution
   - High availability

5. **3 Web Servers (Nginx)**:
   - Secure HTTP handling
   - Static content serving
   - Reverse proxy functionality

6. **3 Application Servers**:
   - Secured business logic
   - Database interaction
   - Dynamic content processing

7. **MySQL Database Cluster**:
   - Primary-Replica setup
   - Encrypted data storage
   - Secure replication

### Security and Monitoring Specifics:

1. **Firewall Purpose**:
   - Access control
   - Network segmentation
   - Threat prevention

2. **HTTPS/SSL**:
   - Data encryption in transit
   - Server authentication
   - Trust establishment

3. **Monitoring Configuration**:
   - System metrics collection
   - Performance tracking
   - Log analysis
   - QPS monitoring via request count

### Infrastructure Issues:

1. **SSL Termination**:
   - Decryption at load balancer
   - Internal traffic potentially unencrypted
   - Additional security measures needed

2. **Write Scalability**:
   - Single write-capable MySQL server
   - Potential bottleneck
   - Single point of failure

3. **Uniform Server Components**:
   - Resource competition
   - Lack of specialization
   - Maintenance complexity
   - Scale limitations

4. **Monitoring Overhead**:
   - Resource consumption
   - Network bandwidth usage
   - Storage requirements
