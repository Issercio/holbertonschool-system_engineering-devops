# Simple Web Stack

## Infrastructure Explanation

When a user wants to access www.foobar.com, the following components work together:

### Components:

1. **Server**: Physical or virtual machine (IP: 8.8.8.8)
   - Hardware/software that serves and processes requests
   - Hosts all components needed to deliver the website

2. **Domain Name (foobar.com)**:
   - Human-readable address that maps to server IP
   - WWW record is an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8
   
3. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
   - Handles HTTP requests
   - Serves static content
   - Manages reverse proxy to application server

4. **Application Server**:
   - Executes application logic
   - Processes dynamic content
   - Communicates with database

5. **Application Files**:
   - Contains website codebase
   - Business logic and website functionality

6. **Database (MySQL)**:
   - Stores website data
   - Manages data operations
   - Ensures data persistence

### Communication Flow:
- Client-Server communication uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- TCP/IP protocol suite handles data transmission

### Infrastructure Issues:

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**:
   - Single server = single point of failure
   - No redundancy or failover

2. **Maintenance Downtime**:
   - Updates require server restart
   - No redundancy during maintenance
   - Results in service interruption

3. **Scalability Limitations**:
   - Cannot handle high traffic loads
   - No load balancing
   - Limited by single server resources
