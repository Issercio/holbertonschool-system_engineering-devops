## Infrastructure Overview

This scaled-up infrastructure separates components onto dedicated servers and adds load balancer clustering:

### Components:

1. **2 Load Balancers (HAproxy)**:
   - Configured as a cluster
   - High availability
   - Enhanced reliability
   - Load distribution

2. **Dedicated Web Server**:
   - Nginx configuration
   - Static content handling
   - HTTP request processing
   - Separated from application logic

3. **Dedicated Application Server**:
   - Business logic isolation
   - Resource optimization
   - Specialized scaling
   - Focused performance tuning

4. **Dedicated Database Server**:
   - MySQL configuration
   - Data storage specialization
   - Independent resource allocation
   - Optimized for database operations

### Component Separation Benefits:

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Dedicated resources per role
   - Optimized performance
   - Independent scaling
   - Targeted maintenance

2. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Component isolation
   - Reduced attack surface
   - Granular access control
   - Focused security measures

3. **Maintenance Advantages**:
   - Independent updates
   - Role-specific monitoring
   - Simplified troubleshooting
   - Reduced downtime impact

4. **Scaling Flexibility**:
   - Component-specific scaling
   - Resource optimization
   - Cost-effective growth
   - Performance tuning
