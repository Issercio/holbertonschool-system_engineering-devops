# Distributed Web Infrastructure

## Infrastructure Overview

This three-server infrastructure for www.foobar.com includes load balancing and database replication:

### Components:

1. **2 Servers**:
   - Identical configurations for redundancy
   - Each running web server, application server, and codebase
   - Allows for high availability and fault tolerance

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - Distributes incoming traffic between servers
   - Uses Round Robin algorithm
   - Enables Active-Active setup

3. **Web Server (Nginx) on each server**:
   - Handles HTTP requests
   - Serves static content
   - Acts as reverse proxy

4. **Application Server on each server**:
   - Processes dynamic content
   - Executes business logic
   - Communicates with database

5. **MySQL Database Cluster**:
   - Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) configuration
   - Primary: handles writes
   - Replica: handles reads, syncs with Primary

### Specifics Explained:

1. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   - Round Robin algorithm: requests distributed sequentially
   - Active-Active setup: both servers handle traffic simultaneously
   - (vs Active-Passive where one server is on standby)

2. **Database Primary-Replica**:
   - Primary node: handles write operations
   - Replica node: replicates Primary data
   - Provides read scalability and backup
   - Asynchronous replication

### Infrastructure Issues:

1. **SPOF (Single Points of Failure)**:
   - Load balancer is single point of failure
   - Primary MySQL database

2. **Security Issues**:
   - No firewall protection
   - No HTTPS encryption
   - Exposed ports and services

3. **Monitoring Gaps**:
   - No monitoring system
   - No performance metrics
   - No alert system
